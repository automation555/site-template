# Trey's Site Template

This is a basic site template that I use as a starting point.

No back-end stuff: Markup, CSS, and JavaScript.

Quickly create a new local project from this repository by using [this script](http://gist.github.com/292032 "gist: 292032 - Create a new project based on my site-template project.- GitHub").
