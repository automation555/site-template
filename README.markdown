This is a basic site template that I use as a starting place on new project as I start slicing it in Photoshop.

No back-end stuff.  This is just a starting place for Markup, CSS, and JavaScript.

You have a choice of using Sass or regular CSS.  If you want to use Sass, modify the files in the `/css/sass/` folder, which generates the `/css/screen.css` file.  If you want to use regular CSS, you can delete the `/css/sass/` folder and keep `reset.css` and `base.css`.

Folder structure:

	.
	|-- css
	|   |-- ie
	|   |   |-- 5mac.css
	|   |   |-- 5win.css
	|   |   |-- 6.css
	|   |   `-- all.css
	|   |-- img
	|   |   |-- blt
	|   |   `-- btn
	|   |-- base.css
	|   |-- html5.css
	|   |-- reset.css
	|-- img
	|-- js
	|   |-- load.js
	|   `-- jquery.toggleval.js
	|-- html4.html
	|-- html4_lean.html
	|-- html5.html
	|-- robots.txt
	|-- xhtml.html
	`-- xhtml_full.html
